# OrigAdmin GitHub Template for Go Projects

This repository contains the default community health files and GitHub Actions workflows for Go projects within the [OrigAdmin](https://github.com/origadmin) organization.

## 📋 What's Included

### 🛠️ GitHub Actions Workflows

All workflows are located in the `.github/workflows-template` directory and are configured to **not** run in this template repository itself. They will automatically activate when you create a new repository from this template.

- **Test (`test.yml`)** - Runs `go build` and `go test` across multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and Go versions.
- **Release (`release.yml`)** - Automates versioning and release creation using [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) when a new `v*` tag is pushed.
- **CodeQL (`codeql-analysis.yml`)** - Performs static code analysis to find security vulnerabilities.
- **Dependabot (`dependabot.yml`)** - Keeps `go.mod` dependencies up-to-date by creating automated pull requests.

### 📝 Community Health Files

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Guidelines for contributing to projects.
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** - The Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.
